AC4 take most time and AC3 takes least time
AC3<AC1<AC2<AC4
problem specific. cz domain and range specific. [1,1000] , 50 domains. also depends on the contraints.

Findings: 
for node vs time: Node increased time required increases


Why AC-3 is Almost Always Better than AC-4 for
Establishing Arc Consistency in CSPs	

- significantly better than that of the simple strategy of
scanning all pairs until no inconsistencies are found



Rene dechter mashrur-
In the best case AC-1,AC-3 is e.k steps (problem already arc consistent)
The best of AC-4 remains ek^2  create data structure in the initial phase
when constraints are loose  t is close to k^2 1,3 may frequently outperforms AC-4
AC-4 optimal in worst case.



why reduced with respect to graph density?

for higher edges:
since more edges more more constraints so after checking some edges no more satisfaction
but for smaller edges less constraints and more satisfactions
